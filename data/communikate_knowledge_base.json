She first took her time to do research on who I am, why & how I run my business the way I do, then gave practical constructive criticism and wise suggestions. After a series of comparative analysis of other logos in the same industry (both local and national), we went over what I like and don't like, what embodies me and sets me apart from the competition. Then after creating multiple logos for me, she took her time with me to add in and take away different aspects of the logo and color schemes. Finally we had the final product that I absolutely LOVE & proud to rock every day... and all my family, friends, current and past clients love the new look as well!!! Thanks again Katie - looking forward to working on other projects together in the future!",
